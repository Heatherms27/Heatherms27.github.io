### Finding Periods of Linear Recurrence Relations
#### Advisor: Dr. Julian Dymacek, Longwood University
##### Jan 2017 - May 2017; Jan 2018 - May 2018

* Created and implemented multiple algorithms for quickly finding Pisano Periods using properties of linear recurrence relations and modular arithmetic
* Analyzed efficiency of algorithms by comparing fully optimized compiler run times over multiple trials

### A Statistical Analysis of SameGame
#### Advisor: Dr. Philip Poplin, Longwood University
##### Aug 2017 - Dec 2017

* Developed, designed, and implemented multiple algorithms to solve a randomly generated board of SameGame 
* Compared means, margins of error, and residuals to determine which algorithms performed best using one of the game's standardized scoring methods
* Generated three-dimensional equations using least squares linear regression to model the predicted scores given varying board sizes using the top seven of the twenty-five specific algorithms
