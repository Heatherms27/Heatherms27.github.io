<p>Hey there! My name is Heather Switzer and I am currently a second-year M.S./Ph.D. student at the College of William & Mary located 
in Williamsburg, VA. There, I study Computer Science with a specialization in Computational Science. My research interests include 
computational science, graph theory, and numerical linear algebra. When I'm not at school, I enjoy watching anime, playing video games,
and birdwatching (I know, I'm super interesting).</p>
